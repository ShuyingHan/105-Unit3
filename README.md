# 105-Unit3

## What is inculded? 
The repository contains one python notebook, two dataset and  data visualization:
- The file in Python_notebook directory containes [instruction code](/Python_notebook/instruction_code.ipynb) to conduct basis data analysis. 
- The data directory contain one raw dataset [public_health_dataset.csv](/data/public_health_dataset.csv), the corresponding filtered [subset.csv](/data/subset.csv) using the data analysis code provided by the python notebook and two image generated using the subset.csv.

## Where did the data come from? 
The raw dataset  `public_health_dataset.csv` is provided by [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho)


## What could the instruction and data be used for? 
In general, the material in the repository offered a detailed intruction and an example for members in the science who wants to generate target subset csv file from large data frame that would contribute to their future research. </br>

To be more specific, scientist in field of public health could utlized the dataset and the instruction provided to analyze the relationship between life expectancy, mathernal mortality rate and total population in a country. 


## DATA VISUALIZATION 
Using the data from the `subsets.csv` , we could generate the image below that highlights countries with life expectancy over 73.3 and listed its corresponding maternal mortality rate.

To futhere anazlyz the dataset, we could then generate a similar map that highlights the total population of the countries with life expectancy over 73.3 as additional information.
