# 105-Unit3

## What is inculded? 
The repository contains one python notebook, two dataset and  data visualization:
- The file in Python_notebook directory containes [instruction code](/Python_notebook/instruction_code.ipynb) to conduct basis data analysis. 
- The data directory contain one raw dataset [public_health_dataset.csv](/data/public_health_dataset.csv), the corresponding filtered [subset.csv](/data/subset.csv) created using the data analysis code provided by the python notebook and two image generated using the data in subset.csv.

## Where did the data come from? 
The raw dataset  `public_health_dataset.csv` is provided by [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho)


## What could the instruction and data be used for? 
In general, the material in the repository offered a detailed intruction and an example for members in the science who wants to generate target subset csv file from large data frame that would contribute to their future research. </br>

To be more specific, in the example provided in the repository, scientist in field of public health could utlized the dataset and the instruction provided to analyze the relationship between life expectancy, mathernal mortality rate and total population in a country. As the growing population around the globe has become a heated topic, being abble to narrow down certain outstanding countries would offer a starting point for related research focusing on the factors of the rapid growing population. 


## Data visualization
Using the data from the `subsets.csv` , we could generate the image below that highlights countries with life expectancy over 73.3 and listed its corresponding maternal mortality rate.

To futhere anazlyz the dataset, we could then generate a similar map that highlights the total population of the countries with life expectancy over 73.3 as additional information.

## Licensing
In general, the data and code instruction is open to the public though may be especially useful to the scientific community for research with massive dataset.</br>
