# 105-Unit3

This is a repository containing a python notebook for data compilation instructions and sample datasets for scientists and data analysts.

The material in the repository offered a detailed intruction and a sample for scientists to generate target subset csv file from large data frame that would contribute to future research. 

The repository contains one python notebook and two dataset:
- The file in Python_notebook directory containes [instruction code](/Python_notebook/Feeder3.1.ipynb) to conduct basis data analysis. 
- The data directory contain one raw dataset: [public_health_dataset.csv](/data/public_health_dataset.csv) and the corresponding filtered [subset.csv](/data/subset.csv) using the data analysis code provided by the python notebook.

The raw dataset  `public_health_dataset.csv` is provided by [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho)



## DATA VISUALIZATION 
Using the data from the `subsets.csv` , we could generate the image below that highlights countries with life expectancy over 73.3 and listed its corresponding maternal mortality rate.

To futhere anazlyz the dataset, we could then generate a similar map that highlights the total population of the countries with life expectancy over 73.3 as additional information.
